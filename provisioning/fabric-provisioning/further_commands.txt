Just some more or less important commands:

- find ./crypto/*/*/tlsca/ -type f -name tlsca.*.pem | xargs cat # to get all certificates from the corresponding folder
- sh -c "truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log" # to clear Docker container logs as they may grow very large
- ansible containerHost -m command -a "docker stop peer0.peerone.com" # basically arbitrary commands can be executed on the hosts, this command could be used to check how the network behaves when a container "crashes"
- ansible benchmarking-client -m copy -a "src=/home/hyperledger-provisioning/chatApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar dest=/home/hyperledger-provisioning/chatApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar" # almost the same as the one above but shows how to copy relevant files like a newly compiled JAR file
- ./runBenchmark.sh target/ chatApplication-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.hm.dako.chat.benchmarking.BenchmarkingUserInterfaceSimulation ~/client_new/ hostName-
 ca.pem 50 5 # how to run the Benchmarking Shell Script manually, see the script contents for the specific parameters
