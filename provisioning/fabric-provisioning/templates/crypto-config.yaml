# If you want to use certificates in production environments it is advised to build a custom network
# which is specialized in building customized certificates for the participants in the network
#
# This configuration files is used on the present scenario. It is used to create certificates which
# are following a specific structure and are generated using the structure of this configuration #file. This configuration file, providing the template is reducing the effort to manually create certificates enormously
